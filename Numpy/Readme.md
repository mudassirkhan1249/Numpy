# 📊 NumPy Practice & Mini Projects

This repository contains my **self-learning based hands-on practice** and mini projects using **NumPy**, aimed at building strong foundations for **Data Science** and scientific computing.

Instead of only learning theory, I focused on **solving problems, practicing array operations, and implementing logic-based exercises** to understand how mathematics works with Python.

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (basic usage for visualization)

---

## 📚 What I Learned & Practiced

### 🔹 NumPy Basics
- Creating arrays (1D, 2D)
- Array indexing & slicing
- Array reshaping
- Data types and shape handling

### 🔹 Array Operations
- Element-wise operations
- Mathematical operations on arrays
- Understanding vectorized computations

---

### 🔹 Practice Problems (Self Learning)
I solved multiple practice problems using NumPy logic, including:

- Creating an array of **student marks**
- Finding:
  - Average
  - Maximum & Minimum
  - Mean
  - Percentage
  - Failures
  - Toppers
- Applying conditions and logical filtering on arrays

All problems were solved independently as part of my **self-learning journey**.

### 🔹 Exercises & Logical Problems
Inside the exercise files, I practiced logic-based problems such as:
- **Valid Sudoku (logic-based array validation)**
- Other array manipulation and reasoning-based NumPy questions

These exercises helped improve my **problem-solving mindset** using NumPy.

### 🔹 Trigonometric Functions
- `sin()` and `cos()` using radians
- Working with arrays instead of single values
- Understanding how NumPy handles mathematical functions on arrays

---

### 🔹 Data Visualization (Basic)
- Line plots
- Subplots
- Visualizing mathematical and numerical data using Matplotlib
